# Othello Minmax

This code was developed for the course Introduction to Artificial Intelligence at Politchnika Wroclawska University during the year 2019 - 2020.

The aim of the code is to develop game-playing artificial intelligence models based on search algorithms. For this reason, two common games are used:
- Sudoku
- Othello

For the first game, search with backtracking is used to fill different sudoku games with variying difficulty.

The second game uses min-max algorithm along with alpha-beta pruning to develop a computer player for the Othello game, taking into account different strategy considerations into its modelling.
