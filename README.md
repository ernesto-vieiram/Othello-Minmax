# Othello Minmax

This code was developed for the course Introduction to Artificial Intelligence at Politchnika Wroclawska University during the year 2019 - 2020.

The aim of the code is to develop game-playing artificial intelligence models based on search algorithms. The project consists in using min-max algorithm along with alpha-beta pruning to develop a computer player for the Othello game, taking into account different strategy considerations into its modelling.
